Overview
========
The ``dblib`` library is a mid-level CPython database interface project 
which is designed to fit between ``sqlalchemy`` and *your* database 
interface library.

The interface exposes methods for easily executing SQL statements and
calling stored procedures - with minimal setup.

As of this release, the following database engines are supported:

- MySQL / MariaDB
- Oracle
- SQLite3 
- SQL Server (coming soon)
