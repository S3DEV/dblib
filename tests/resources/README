In the event the testing environment moves, the database is corrupted 
or any scripts are lost or damaged, the database can be completely
rebuilt (or established) using the scripts contained in the 
mysqlsetup_*.tar.gz archive.

The *.sh shell scripts are wrappers around the .sql script and can be 
used for deployment or database teardown. These shell scripts are executed
by the testing modules via a subprocess call.
